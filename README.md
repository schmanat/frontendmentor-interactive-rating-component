## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [headlessui](https://headlessui.dev/)

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to use TailwindCSS with there responsive utility classes. I also used Vite the first time. I tried to reuse the markup (created components).
I know that its possible to create more components, but I think i have found a nice compromise

### Continued development

Nothing is perfect, so I have a few ideas to improve this solution.

- use TypeScript to be type safe
- create more components (i.e. Headline, Paragraph)
- create a nice fade effect, after submitting
- ...
